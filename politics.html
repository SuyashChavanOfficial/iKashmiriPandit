                            After centuries of decimation of our population within Kashmir valley, the 1990 pogrom by
                            Islamic terrorists and their supporters against us was the final act that expelled almost
                            the entire remaining 400,000 strong population of Kashmiri Pandits - something that has
                            unfortunately gone largely unreported in the Western press. These Pandits are at present
                            living as refugees in their own country. While the expelled refugees as well as our
                            worldwide community have not resorted to any form of violent means to regain our territory,
                            we have never accepted this ethnic cleansing as final. We are carrying on a non-violent war
                            through legitimate political means and by using the Internet to disseminate the truth about
                            how Islamic interests have caused the near-extinction of our community in their zeal to
                            convert the valley into the next Afghanistan. This non-violent war will continue until we
                            win back our homeland and the right to live there without being subject to Islamic hegemony.
                            We will also continue to use these non-violent means to ensure that the government of India
                            does not barter our interests away in the process of placating Islamic terrorist groups in
                            Kashmir.

                                    gardens and gentle people has been reduced to a region of ghosts because of the

                                    instigating them into terrorism. This booklet gives a brief insight into the role of

The policies of the Government of India that have contributed to the alienation of the different religious communities of the State are analyzed. The militancy is seen as an attempt by the fundamentalists to wean the Kashmiri Muslims away from their heritage of Rishi Islam that includes elements of Shaivism. <a href=""> >>> </a></p>
